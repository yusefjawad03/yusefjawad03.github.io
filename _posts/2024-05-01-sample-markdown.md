The Apple App Store requires developers to include privacy nutrition labels to their applications. This data 
has been documented, but I tried making it more accessible for users. By scraping data for a few weeks, and building an interface that allows dynamic viewing, this first iteration of a project can include statistics of nutrition labels, lists of all apps store, and the data they collect per app for every week the scraping of data occurs.
